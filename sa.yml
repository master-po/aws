aws

ec2
    user data
        commands to be run when instance is initiated
    on-demand
        pay for what you use
        highest cost but not upfront payment
        no long term committment
        recommended for short-term and uninterrupted workloads with predictable application behavior
    reserved instance
        up to 75% discount compared to on-demand
        pay upfront
        1 or 3 year reservation
        reserve a specific instance type
        good for databases
    convertible reserved instance
        RI but can change instance type
        up to 54$ discount
    scheduled reserved instance
        launch within a reserved window
        only reuired to run periodically
    spot instances
        up to 90% discount compared to ondemand
        spot pricing is variable and a max price is set for the workloads
        workload won't run if spot pricing exceeds max
        can be one-time or persistent
            one-time runs once
            persistent runs whenevr price is below threshold
        best for workloads that are resilient to failure
            batch jobs
            data analysis
            image processing
            additional resources for peak usage
            not databases or critical jobs
        spot block
            spot instance that is reserved for 1-6 hours
    dedicated host
        dedicated hardware
        provides user with visibility into underlying sockets/cores
        3 year reservation
        can be useful for PITA licensing
        good for strong compliance/security needs
    instance type
        R - good for apps that require a lot of RAM
        C - good for apps that require a lot of 
        M - good for medium apps such as web apps
        I - good for apps that require high storage IO
        G - good for apps that require GPU
        T2/T3 - busrtable instances
            utilizes burst credits
            credits accumulate over time
            similar to QoS tokens
        T2/T3 unlimited - unlimited burst
            no limit on bursts but there is a charge when it happens
AMI
    amazon machine image
    AMIs from  amazon marketplace can be selected or build your own
    right click on EC2 instance and choose create image
    stored in a specific region
    AMIs can be shared with another account using their account number
    sharing does not change ownership
    if they copy the AMI to another region, they own the copy
    you cant copy an encyrpted AMI that was shared with you
    you cant copy an AMI with an assocaited billingproduct code that was shared with you
    permit/deny copying AMI is controller by "create volume" check box on the permissions window
placement groups
    cluster
        ec2 instances are in same AZ and rack
        low-latency
        decreased availability due to lack of geographic diversity
    spread
        spans instances across multiple availability zones
        limited to 7 instances per AZ placement group
        used to maximize availability
    partition
        instances can be partitioned within a group
        up to 7 partitions per AZ
        used for big data apps like HDFS HBase, Cassandra, Kafka
elastic network interfaces - ENI
    basically a vnic
    can have primary ipv4 addr and 1 or more secondary IP
    can have a elastic public IP
    bound to a specific AZ
    interfaces can be created and assiigned/re-assigned between instances
ec2 hibernate
    preserves memory state
    does not reboot  OS
    only available in C M and R instance types
    max 150 GB RAM supported
    no supported on bare metal instances
    must use encrypted EBS
    on-demand and reserved instances only
ELB
    classic
        http(s) and tcp
        mostly deprecated
    application
        http(s) and websocket
    network
        TCP TLS and UDP
    common security group allows 80/443 from inet to LB  and then LB to the servers
    can scale but not instantaneously
        call aws for "warm-up" if needed
